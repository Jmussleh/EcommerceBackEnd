## Description
The Employee Tracker App is a command-line application designed to efficiently manage employee information. Upon starting the application, users are presented with a menu offering several options, including viewing all departments, roles, and employees, as well as adding departments, roles, employees, and updating employee roles. Choosing to view all departments displays a formatted table showcasing department names and IDs. Selecting the view all roles option presents users with job titles, role IDs, corresponding departments, and salaries. Opting to view all employees showcases a formatted table with employee data, including IDs, first and last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and reporting managers. Adding a department prompts users to enter the department name, which is then added to the database. Similarly, adding a role requires inputting the role name, salary, and associated department. Adding an employee prompts users to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and the employee is subsequently added to the database. Lastly, updating an employee's role involves selecting the employee to update and specifying their new role, which is then updated in the database.
